Fuse the CAD and the boards into one model of a building.

Neither source is enough alone. The CAD has exact walls, doors and the true
envelope, but no room identity and stray linework that splits big rooms. The
boards have clean rooms and real names, but are photographs and miss every
corridor. Registered onto each other:

  * envelope, walls, doors  <- CAD
  * rooms, names, codes     <- boards
  * corridor                <- envelope MINUS rooms, which is Evan's point:
                               nobody has to draw or detect it
  * level 1 envelope        <- the ground floor's, because the structural shell
                               repeats vertically and there is no L1 CAD
